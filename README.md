# NoSpaceScroll

Intercepts spacebar scrolling operations on all websites

## Features

Intercepts global Space and Shift+Space key events on the page. It only prevents the default page up/down scrolling behavior when triggered outside of input fields, text areas, and content-editable regions, ensuring that spacebar input in forms and rich-text editors is not affected.
